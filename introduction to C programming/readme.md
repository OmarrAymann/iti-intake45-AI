## üõ†Ô∏è What Did I Learn?
Through this course, I gained a strong foundation in **C programming**. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key concepts I mastered:

### 1. **Basic Syntax**
   - Writing and running a simple C program.
   - Understanding the structure of a C program (e.g., `#include`, `main()` function).

### 2. **Data Types and Variables**
   - Using basic data types (`int`, `float`, `char`, `double`).
   - Declaring and initializing variables.

### 3. **Control Structures**
   - Using conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`).
   - Implementing loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).

### 4. **Functions**
   - Defining and calling functions.
   - Understanding function parameters and return values.

### 5. **Arrays and Strings**
   - Working with arrays (1D and 2D).
   - Manipulating strings using character arrays.

### 6. **Pointers**
   - Understanding pointers and memory addresses.
   - Using pointers for dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`).
