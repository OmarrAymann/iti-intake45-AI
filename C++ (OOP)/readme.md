## ðŸ›  What did i Learn?

Through this course, I gained a strong foundation in **OOP principles** and their implementation in C++

### 1. **Classes and Objects**
   - Defining classes and creating objects.
   - Using constructors and destructors.
   - Implementing member functions and data members.

### 2. **Encapsulation**
   - Using access specifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`).
   - Implementing getters and setters for controlled access to data.

### 3. **Inheritance**
   - Single and multiple inheritance.
   - Base and derived classes.
   - Function overriding.

### 4. **Polymorphism**
   - Function overloading (compile-time polymorphism).
   - Virtual functions and dynamic binding (runtime polymorphism).

### 5. **Abstraction**
   - Abstract classes and pure virtual functions.

### 6. **Advanced Topics**
   - Operator overloading.
   - Friend functions and classes.
