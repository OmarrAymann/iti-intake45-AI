## üõ†Ô∏è What Did I Learn?
Through this course, I gained a strong foundation in **Python programming**. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key concepts I mastered:

### 1. **Python Basics**
   - Writing and running Python scripts.
   - Understanding Python syntax and indentation.
   - Using variables, data types, and operators.

### 2. **Control Structures**
   - Using conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`).
   - Implementing loops (`for`, `while`).

### 3. **Functions**
   - Defining and calling functions.
   - Understanding function parameters and return values.
   - Using lambda functions.

### 4. **Data Structures**
   - Working with lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
   - Performing operations like slicing, sorting, and filtering.

### 5. **File Handling**
   - Reading from and writing to files (`open`, `read`, `write`).
   - Working with CSV and JSON files.

### 6. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - Defining classes and creating objects.
   - Understanding inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

### 7. **Libraries and Frameworks**
   - Using popular Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

### 8. **Error Handling**
   - Using `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle exceptions.
