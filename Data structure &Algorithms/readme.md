## üõ†Ô∏è What Did I Learn?
Through this course, I gained a strong foundation in **data structures** and **algorithms**. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key concepts I gained:

### 1. **Data Structures**
   - **Linked Lists**: Single linked lists and double linked lists.
   - **Stacks**: LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure with push and pop operations.
   - **Queues**: FIFO (First In, First Out) structure with enqueue and dequeue operations.

### 2. **Time Complexity**
   - Understanding **Big O notation** to analyze the efficiency of algorithms.
   - Calculating time complexity for common operations.

### 3. **Algorithm Design Techniques**
   - **Divide and Conquer**: Breaking problems into smaller subproblems (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort).
   - **Greedy Method**: Making locally optimal choices at each step (e.g., Huffman Coding, Knapsack Problem).
   - **Dynamic Programming**: Solving problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems (e.g., Fibonacci, Matrix Chain Multiplication).

### 4. **Advanced Topics**
   - **Matrix Chain Multiplication**: Optimizing the order of matrix multiplications to minimize operations.
