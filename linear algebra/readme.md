## üõ†Ô∏è What Did I Learn?
Through this course, I gained a strong foundation in **linear algebra**. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key concepts I mastered:

### 1. **Vectors and Vector Spaces**
   - Representing vectors in 2D and 3D spaces.
   - Performing vector operations (addition, subtraction, dot product, cross product).
   - Understanding vector spaces, subspaces, and linear independence.

### 2. **Matrices**
   - Representing matrices and performing operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication).
   - Calculating the determinant, trace, and inverse of a matrix.
   - Solving systems of linear equations using matrices.

### 3. **Linear Transformations**
   - Understanding linear transformations and their representation as matrices.
   - Applying transformations like rotation, scaling, and translation.

### 4. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**
   - Calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
   - Understanding their applications in stability analysis and dimensionality reduction.

### 5. **Matrix Decompositions**
   - Performing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
   - Understanding their applications in solving linear systems and data compression.

### 6. **Applications in Machine Learning**
   - Using linear algebra in algorithms like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Regression.
   - Understanding the role of matrices in neural networks.
