   - Understanding file permissions (`rwx`) for users, groups, and others.
   - Changing permissions using `chmod` and ownership using `chown`.

### 3. **Process Management**

   - Managing processes using `kill`, `bg`, `fg`, and `jobs`.

### 4. **Shell Scripting**
   - Writing and executing shell scripts (`bash`).
