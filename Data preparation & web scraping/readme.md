## üõ†Ô∏è What Did I Learn?
Through this course, I gained a strong foundation in **data preparation techniques**. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key concepts I gained:

### 1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Identifying and handling missing values (e.g., imputation, deletion).
   - Removing duplicates and irrelevant data.
   - Detecting and handling outliers.

### 2. **Data Transformation**
   - Normalizing and scaling numerical data (e.g., Min-Max Scaling, Z-score normalization).
   - Encoding categorical variables (e.g., One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding).
   - Feature engineering (e.g., creating new features from existing data).

### 3. **Data Integration**
   - Combining data from multiple sources (e.g., merging datasets).
   - Resolving inconsistencies in data formats and units.

### 4. **Data Reduction**
   - Reducing dimensionality using techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis).
   - Selecting relevant features for analysis or modeling.

### 5. **Data Splitting**
   - Splitting data into training, validation, and testing sets.
   - Ensuring balanced datasets for machine learning.

### 6. **Tools and Libraries**
   - Using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Scikit-learn** for data preparation.
   - Visualizing data distributions and transformations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
