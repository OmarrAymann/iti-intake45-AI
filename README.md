Welcome to the repository documenting my journey through the 9-month **ITI Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Program**. This repository contains a collection of resources, projects, and notes covering the fundamentals and advanced topics I have learned during the program.

## Key Topics Covered

### Fundamentals
- **C Programming**: Basics of C programming including data structures and algorithms.
- **C++ (OOP)**: Object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
 - **Python Programming**: Essential libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **Mathematics for Machine Learning**: Linear algebra and probability.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

### Big Data & Web Scraping
- **Web Scraping**: Techniques and tools.
- **Big Data Fundamentals**

### Core Machine Learning Topics
- Supervised Learning: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.
- Unsupervised Learning: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction.
- Model Evaluation: Cross-validation, Grid Search, and metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Advanced AI Topics
